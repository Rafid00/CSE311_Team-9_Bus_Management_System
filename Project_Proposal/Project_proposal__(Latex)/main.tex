    \section*{Introduction}
   {\sffamily
    Buses are one of the most popular public transits. We can hardly find a region where there is no bus service available. Keeping such a huge demand in mind, we have come forward with a bus management system which makes booking a bus service easier than ever before. Using our management system our important users like you can book bus tickets and keep track of their schedule. We put our users at the centre of the system. They make the decision of choosing their destination, and we connect them to the right services.
    }
    \section*{Objective}
        \begin{itemize}
         {\sffamily
        \item To make the environment user-friendly, so that anybody can access the service.
        \item Travellers will remain up-to-date about the timetable changes if certain event occurs, such as government shutdowns, lock downs etc.
        \item Travellers can access the info about the bus in detail, such as info about the driver, the condition of the vehicle, what are the stops, etc.
        \item Travellers can leave a review and a rating on their experience with certain vehicle.
        \item Travellers can report certain event that they didn't like to the authority.
        }
        \end{itemize}

     {\sffamily
    \item \textbf{Book Tickets:} Users will be able to book tickets directly from the website. 
    \item \textbf{Update:} The user can update/ change the ticket booking until 6 hours prior to departure. All the information gets automatically updated whenever any changes are made.

    \section*{Challenges}
    {\sffamily One of the substantial challenges would be the cost maintenance of our system, since we will be working with big data. Also the privacy and security of the user provided data will be our central concern. In addition to that keeping track of roadblocks, lockdown, shutdowns etc. requires us to work with other service providers which can be challenging at times.}
